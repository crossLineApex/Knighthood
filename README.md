# Knighthood

A fun cool variation of real chess game. I was reasearching for various different chess vairations being played and studied by the mathematicians and then I came up with this cool and simple idea.

A Strategic, but simple 2 player game where the objective is to reach the centre of the 5*5 CHESSBOARD with your knight.

The board consists of only two knight at opposte diagonal end.

The first one to reach the middle wins the race.
